# 🎬 IMDb Top 250 Movies Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
An interactive **Power BI Dashboard** that dives deep into the IMDb Top 250 movies list. The project focuses on uncovering the secrets behind "Great Cinema" by analyzing the relationship between movie duration, age ratings, and release years against their average ratings.

## 📊 Key Insights (The "Aha!" Moments)
* **The "Epic" Advantage:** Data shows that movies exceeding **3 hours** (e.g., 3h 15m+) consistently maintain higher average ratings, often nearing **9/10**.
* **Quality is Ageless:** Despite the surge in movie production during the 90s and 2000s, the "Average Rating" remains remarkably stable across decades, proving that entry into this list requires consistent excellence.
* **R-Rated Dominance:** More than **100 movies** in the list are R-rated, suggesting that mature, deep storytelling resonates most with the audience.
* **Modern vs. Classic:** The list is balanced with a slight tilt towards "New" movies (**~60%**), yet "Old" classics maintain an identical average rating, showing no bias in quality.
